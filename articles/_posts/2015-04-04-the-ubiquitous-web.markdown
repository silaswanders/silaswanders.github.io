If you were to look back at the origins of the web, you'd see a fledgling entity trying to discover its place in the world. Code was without semantics and design without purpose. We were, of course, like a child who'd just realized they could dress on their own, but had no sense for coordination in style and fashion. It's come quite a long way since then, to the extent that it touches almost every aspect of our modern life. An absence of connection to the web, to most, feels like an absence of connection to the world.


Because it's only a foundation. Unlike a physical foundation, the web is liquid, and able and willing to transform within the hands of its crafters. It's your individual choice as to whether you need to put yet another hero image for your latest project or make it a fully interactive experience. Claiming everyone's site out there looks the same is like wondering why everyone is driving a Corolla: It's a reliable car and it just works. Frameworks like Bootstrap allow developers who are less inclined towards design to build upon something that can later be easily understood and expanded upon by others who can embrace the role of design more fluently.

At the end of the day, we can either complain that every site out there looks the same or we can complain that everyone's site looks like shit. I however, choose to do neither. As product designers, it is our role to build custom solutions to suit our clients and/or user base. That may mean we needing to stay conservative. There's no need to slow down development for the sake of flairs and whistles that are harder to mantain. That can also mean it's your role to create an out of the box solution. 

Ubiquity arises after a proven and tried method has been established, but it doesn't mean it's our limit. It merely means our forefathers paved the way for the simplicity we are endowed with today. Let's accept... Let's accept it and exceed it.
