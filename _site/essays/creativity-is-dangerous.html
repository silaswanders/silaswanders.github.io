    <p>I want to challenge you to do something seemingly unprecedented: Stop being creative. Don’t think outside the box. Don’t do anything. Instead I want you to take a moment to ponder what it means to be a “Product Designer.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>product designer</strong> |<em>ˈprädəkt dəˈzīnər</em>|
noun
a person who plans the form, look, and/or workings of an article or substance that is manufactured or refined to provide a solution towards a problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many of us became designers because we were intrigued by visual solutions. We weren’t aware that this is what they were, mind you. We merely wanted to be part of a technological revolution that allowed us to create them. It wasn’t until it became more than a hobby and bloomed into a career that we realized how important our roles as pioneers are.</p>

<p>As a designer, you are enlisted with using your creativity to solve problems. Your primary objective is to distill proposed solutions into a viable infrastructure. This is where discipline comes in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In my experience, excellent design is rarely about creating something new. The so-called flash-of-brilliance isn’t about invention. It’s about distillation. It feels so strikingly simple. It doesn’t feel new. It feels like it should have always been that way. Knowing that, I would argue that the best designs come from discipline, not creativity.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a small trend in our industry towards designing award winning designs. Clients often see it as an opportunity to gain exposure and some designers see it as a means of bragging rights. The moment I hear a client mention among many other buzz-words that they are looking for a ground-breaking award winning website design, I feel the world shake as designers worldwide collectively drop bricks.</p>

<p>Don’t compromise a solution’s integrity over</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is this old saying. “You need to know the rules before you break them”. It’s not surprising that people who’ve just started in our industry feel tempted the most to create fancy designs and interactions. These are the designs that often get awwwards, and yet these are the ones many users struggle the most with.”`</p>
