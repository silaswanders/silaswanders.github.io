They say that life flashes before your eyes moments before your death. Too bad everyone qualified to verify this well known myth is part of the collective gathering of ungrateful dead of which I am soon to become a part of. I only wish I'd had a more dignified death. If only my killer weren't so silent and unapologetically self-righteous. In short, I am getting clobbered to death by a red-light running motherfucking Prius.

"Shit..." I sigh.

That's about it. I don't even swear unless I'm pissy drunk. I feel as though if I had been, I'd at least have some remotely epic last words other than shit. I need more time to think.

"If that's what you want..." I hear a voice say.

I fall on my knees, only to feel concern over my dress becoming soiled on the dirty pavement. Yes. Out of all things to be worried at my time of death, it's got to be my dress. Hey, getting hit by cars only to have time slow down is quite commonplace compared to a soiled dress.

"Mother is going to kill me..." I mutter.

"Too late..." Says the voice again.

Except it wasn't  just any voice. It was *his* voice. Of course it is. There we go. This is it. The part where I start thinking of the person I love most before I die. Why am I surprised at the magnificent asshole invading my head once again?

"Magnificent asshole, you say? I'm flattered to see that you find me magnificent even in my assholery." he continu-- 

Wait. Did he just read my mind? Oh, wait, of course he did. He's a figment of my-

"Imaginaaaatoin" he interrupts. "See what I did there? It was a SpongeBob reference. It's funny, because it's relevant and I mispelt it just to make the grammar nazis reading this squirm."

"Huh?" I reply, stunned, my attention still held firmly on the now sluggish car still headed in my direction.

"I broke the fourth wa-- You know what? Never mind. Look at me."

"Huh...? Oh." and 'Oh' indeed. There he was. The magnificent asshole that was Locksley crouching next to me with his usual air of smugness.
He pulls out a bottle of rum and offers me some. I refuse. Last time I remotely touched alcohol my frail body convulsed as though I'd been shown the holy grail of candy shops as a child.

"Oooh. That's a sexy memory. If wine does that to you... Just imagine what we could do on one of your beds. Which, by the way, I know you prefer sleeping on the floor (for whatever God-given reason), but wouldn't it be more efficient to just get rid of one of your beds?"

He continues talking like this for about two minutes. Normally I wouldn't be able to stop laughing, but I didn't even smile. Normally I wouldn't be able to break eye contact with him unless I were blushing violently, and yet, I looked away. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't be able to slap him as fucking hard as I just did, but these weren't exactly normal circumstances, and he was, as a matter of fact, an asshole. 

Oh. My. Word. I just slapped Locksley. Really hard.

"Took you long enough," he replied after a few moments. His glance now vacant and lost in the stars. "Let's go get coffee."
And just like that he got up, dusted himself off, and offered me a hand.

"Please...?"

How dare he show his face here again. After I told him to leave my life. How dare he do this to me. I don't care if this is nothing but a hallucination. I don't want to see him ever again.
"Okay," I reply and take his hand.
