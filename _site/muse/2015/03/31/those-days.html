    <p>It was a depressing night, it was a fantastic night, fueled by nothing more than tedium in a life tainted with rebellion and angst. Cigarettes strung one after the other like the strings on a worn violin. Broken glass and broken minds. Ripe bodies and passionate nights of simplicity with complex lovers. Colors hardly suited us. We lead the black and white photograph life our offspring was destined to read in history books. The screams and banter of youth filled the night sky with laughter. That laughter was genuine once, perhaps a night or two ago, but tonight it was the plead of the insane. We laughed because crying wasn’t worth reading about, we laughed because we knew that for that second… We… Were infinite.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So let us be tourist 
And I but a nomad
With no place to settle
But the hearts we share
Whom we shall evermore
Call our home</p>
